# fishing-optimizer-tof

This program is meant to be used for the Fishing Gameplay in the game Tower of Fantasy. There are daily fishing activities that you can perform in the game with everyday have certain chances of fishes appearing. The prices of the fishes are different each day depending on the yesterdays prices. This means that we don't know the actual fish price, just that it has either gone up or gone down. 

This program will take in an image, and extract all the numbers and names from the image. Then it will perform calculations and to figure out which fish is the best value of the day.

The fishes are also sorted into 3 tiers of rarity. This should in future be taken into account since the kind of fishing rod also matters a lot when catching a fish.
